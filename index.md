Multiscript is a desktop application for combining Bible versions for multicultural Christian ministry. It simplifies
the process of collating each passage and version in all the combinations that you need.

# Why Multiscript?
As our world becomes more globalised, more and more Christian ministries are becoming multicultural. Multicultural
ministries regularly need copies of the Bible with one or more versions shown in parallel. For example, a Bible
study may have some guests who need an English and Chinese version together, and other guests who need an English and
Spanish version. The more multicultural the ministry, the larger the number of combinations required. 

One solution to this problem is to have parallel printed Bibles for everyone. But many ministries don't have access to
a large library with enough Bibles for every guest and every language combination required. A common alternative
is to access Bible websites that offer multiple translations in a parallel layout. Yet there are many
times when a printed handout is preferable – especially if you want to see more text than can fit on a screen, or
encourage guests to write notes directly on the page. You could instead try to manually create handouts of the exact
passages and versions that you need. But as soon as you have more than a few languages represented, the number of
combinations simply becomes too large to generate manually.

Multiscript aims to address this problem. You provide the app with a list of the Bible passages and versions you need,
as a well as a template for the handout you’re producing. It collects the passages online, and uses the template to
create a separate file for each version combination. These files can then be printed, subject to copyright and
licensing restrictions.

# Key Features
Multiscript is designed to be easy to use, while also being highly flexible in the output it produces. A basic plugin
system allows for further customisation.

The code is currently pre-release, so you should expect bugs. If you have skills that would benefit the project,
we'd love to hear from you! In particular, we'd like to extend the range of free Bible versions available.

Current Bible versions supported:
  - Most of the versions available from [GetBible.net](https://getbible.net/)

Current template formats supported:
  - Microsoft Word
  - Plain text

# Downloads
The code is currently pre-release, so you should expect bugs. The installers below are not currently code-signed, so
you may have to override warning messages from your operating system when installing and running the application for
the first time. If you have skills that would help us improve the project, we'd love to hear from you!
