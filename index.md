Multiscript is a desktop application for combining Bible passages in multiple languages for multicultural Christian ministry. It simplifies the process of collating different combinations of Bible versions for a set of passages.

# Why Multiscript?
As our world becomes more globalised, more and more Christian ministries are becoming multicultural. Multicultural ministries often need copies of Bible passages for an event, usually with one or more Bible versions shown in parallel. For example, you might be running a Bible study, and have some guests who need an English and Chinese version together, and other guests who need an English and Spanish version. The more multicultural the ministry, the larger the number of combinations needed. 

One solution to this problem is to have parallel printed Bibles for everyone. But this doesn't work when you have a large number of guests, or the ministry is too small or too mobile to access a large printed library, or you simply don't own parallel Bibles for the language combinations you need. A common alternative is to use an online device to access the many popular Bible websites that offer multiple translations in a parallel layout. But there are many occasions when a printed handout is preferable – especially if you want to see more text than can fit on a screen, or encourage guests to make written notes directly on the page. You can, of course, use Bible websites or Bible software to manually create the handouts you need. But as soon as you have more than a few languages represented, the number of combinations becomes too large and too time-consuming to create everything by hand.

Multiscript aims to address this problem. You provide the app with a list of the Bible passages and versions you need, as a well as a template for the handout you’re producing. It collects the passages online, and uses the template to create a separate file for each version combination. These files can then be printed, subject to copyright and licensing restrictions.

# Key Features
Multiscript is designed to be easy to use, while also being highly flexible in the output it produces. A basic plugin system allows for further customisation.
